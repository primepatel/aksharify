## What is AsciiArt

ASCII art is a style of art in which people make graphics and designs by using letters, numbers, and symbols from a unique set of characters known as ASCII. ASCII painters create intriguing images by arranging these characters in patterns and forms rather than using colours and brushes as in traditional art. They meticulously select the appropriate characters and combine them to produce images of animals, people, or even landscapes. It's almost as if you're sketching with letters and symbols! ASCII art is a fun way for artists to express themselves using only the basic characters present on a computer keyboard.

## Motivation

The inspiration for this module came from a Numberphile video called "The Trinity Hall Prime," which I first saw in high school days. It motivated me to explore the possibilities of such a prime number. I created a Python module that uses a predetermined character set to turn photos into ASCII art. It manipulates images using the PIL package, transforming them to grayscale before mapping pixel values to ASCII letters. Users can change the character set to get different effects.
